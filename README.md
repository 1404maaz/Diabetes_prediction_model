# Diabetes_prediction_model

This repository contains a diabetes prediction model built on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier algorithm. The model predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on input features such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, and Age. The dataset consists of 768 data points, with 80% used for training and 20% for testing.

# Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create an accurate diabetes prediction model utilizing the SVM classifier. Google Colab was employed for development, and dependencies include NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.
